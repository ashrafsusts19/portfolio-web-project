                            I have over 382 days of problem solving streak in codeforces. For practice, I always try to maintain consistency and
                            solve the hardest problems within my ability, relying on outside help as little as possible.

                        In my freshman year, I spent time learning random stuff, among which there was this one algorithm 
                        I learnt that allowed my generate Perlin like Noise. I made this 2d visualization of perlin noise                        
                        using pygame in python.

                        Back then when I hadn't started competitive programming yet, I made this random maze generator
                        app using python. It used to generate random mazes using randomized dfs and also included a functionality
                        to find path between any two nodes

                    <p>
                        Inspired by my python project, I decided that I will build a Tetris game from scratch with fully 
                        customizable blocks, in-game block builder, game-modes, settings etc. Back then I unintentionally 
                        used (although poorly designed) some design pattern ideas which I came to learn latter in my 5th 
                        semester.

                    <p>
                        Developing the nes emulator was a difficult task, and I still have some bugs unsolved as you can see
                        in the image. Cumbersome coding, lack of testing envioronment made this project very difficult and tedious
                        to debug and complete. Also, I had the graphics rendering done using cpu. Which made the 
                        application very CPU intensive and slow given the hardware I was trying to emulate. But good achievement for me anyways.
